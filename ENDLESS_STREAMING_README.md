# Endless Speech Recognition Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds **endless streaming speech recognition** to your TTS-Engine project, based on Google Cloud's endless streaming example. The key improvement is that it automatically handles Google Cloud's 4-minute streaming limitation by seamlessly restarting the connection with audio bridging.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Endless Streaming Client
- **File**: `adapters/clients/google_stt_endless_streaming_client.py`
- **Features**:
  - Continuous streaming with automatic restarts every 4 minutes
  - Audio bridging to ensure no speech is lost during restarts
  - Timing correction for seamless transcript continuity
  - Compatible with existing STT streaming interface

### 2. Integrated with Existing API
- **No frontend changes required** ✅
- Your existing WebSocket endpoint `/api/stt/stream` now uses endless streaming
- Same configuration and audio data format
- Same response format with additional restart information

### 3. Key Benefits
- **Truly endless streaming**: No more 4-minute cutoffs
- **Seamless operation**: Audio bridging prevents gaps in recognition
- **Backward compatible**: Existing clients work without modification
- **Better reliability**: Automatic recovery from stream interruptions

## How It Works

### Stream Restart Logic
1. **Before 4 minutes**: Normal streaming recognition
2. **At 4 minutes**: Automatically starts new stream
3. **Audio bridging**: Replays recent audio to maintain context
4. **Timing correction**: Adjusts timestamps for continuous timeline

### Audio Buffering
- Maintains buffer of recent audio chunks
- Calculates optimal bridging offset during restarts
- Ensures smooth transition between stream sessions

### Client Events
Your existing frontend will receive these additional events:
- `stream_restart`: Notifies when a stream restarts (with restart count)
- Same `final_result` and `interim_result` events as before
- Timestamps are corrected to show continuous timeline

## Configuration

The endless streaming uses the same configuration as regular streaming:

```javascript
socket.emit('config', {
    config: {
        encoding: 'WEBM_OPUS',
        sampleRateHertz: 16000,
        languageCode: 'en-US',
        interimResults: true,
        enableWordTimeOffsets: true,
        enableAutomaticPunctuation: true,
        model: 'latest_long'
    }
});
```

## Result Format

Results now include restart information:

```javascript
{
    type: 'final_result',
    transcript: 'Hello world',
    confidence: 0.95,
    corrected_time: 125000,  // Corrected timeline in milliseconds
    restart_count: 2,        // Number of stream restarts
    wordTimestamps: [...]    // Same as before
}
```

## Benefits Over Standard Streaming

### Before (Standard Streaming)
- ❌ 4-minute limitation
- ❌ Manual restart required
- ❌ Potential audio loss during restarts
- ❌ Timestamp discontinuity

### After (Endless Streaming)
- ✅ Truly endless recognition
- ✅ Automatic seamless restarts
- ✅ No audio loss with bridging
- ✅ Continuous timeline
- ✅ Same API, no frontend changes

## Removed Components

- **Gunicorn**: Removed to avoid async conflicts with Google APIs
- **Direct Flask server**: Now uses Flask-SocketIO's built-in server
- Uses `threading` async mode for compatibility

## Running the Application

```bash
# Development
python run.py

# Docker
docker-compose up
```

The application will now provide endless streaming capabilities on the same endpoints your frontend already uses!

## Technical Notes

- Stream restarts happen automatically every ~4 minutes
- Audio bridging uses recent audio buffer for context
- Timing corrections ensure continuous transcript timeline
- Compatible with all existing client implementations
- No changes needed to existing WebSocket clients
